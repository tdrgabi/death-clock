It's supposed to count the seconds until you reach a certain age (80) and die.

To install just copy the server file to  /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/ and the py
file to /usr/bin/. Make sure you have the rights to execute the deathclock.py

Once installed you will find the application among gnome-panel's applets

The end date is currently hardcoded but the code is dead easy to modify.
